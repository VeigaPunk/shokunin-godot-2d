# game-dev-2d scorecard — mint

Owned axes: depth, coverage, calibration. Scores remain unassigned without a
quality rubric; a row count is a measurement, not a score or verdict.

| axis | score | evidence / counting command | last change |

planned: calibration — direct-child Linux SIGTERM and one real Godot timeout are probed; spontaneous crashes, process-tree timeout, startup-margin robustness, and other diagnostic shapes remain unprobed. Coverage: production-project launch, GUI/rendering, and other platforms remain unprobed. The relative-export-target failure is causally reproduced and both fixture export targets normalized at r25; historical r16/r20/r24 adverse and first r25 49/50 remain recorded, with production/general export reliability unproven.
retired: none.
